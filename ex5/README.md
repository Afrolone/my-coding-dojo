# Modify a sentence by reversing order of occurrences of all Palindrome Words
Given a string S representing a sentence, the task is to reverse the order of all palindromic words present in the sentence.

Examples:

    Input: S = “mom and dad went to eye hospital”
    Output: eye and dad went to mom hospital
    Explanation: All palindromic words present in the string are “mom”, “dad” and “eye“, in the order of their occurrence. Reversing the order of their occurrence generates the sequence {“eye”, “dad”, “mom”}. Therefore, the modified string is “eye and dad went to mom hospital”.

    Input : S = “wow it is next level”
    Output: level it is next wow.
